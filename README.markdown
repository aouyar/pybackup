pybackup - Backup Script in Python
==================================

Python Module for implementing backup scripts.

Development started, when I was fed up with developing custom shell scripts for 
each backup task, and needed something with better error checking and reporting.

Backup methods are implemented by plugins that can be loaded at startup.

WARNING: This is still alpha software.

The documentation for the project and sample graphs for plugins will be
